# JavaScript Quiz

## This is a quiz to test the user on basic elements of JavaScript.

## It asks 6 questions in multiple choice format.  It is timed with incorrect answers resulting in a penalty loss of 10 seconds.  Their score is the time remaining at the end of the quiz. After the game, the player is prompted for their initials and their score is stored in the local memory.  They are then taken to another page that lists the top 5 scores and given the option to play again.

## This quiz uses JavaScript objects to store the questions and answer choices.  JavaScript is also being used to handle the different events that happen and create the high score list.
